- **User input**
- **Variables**
- **Basic data types**

## 🛠️ Requirements

Before starting this assignment, make sure you have the following set up:

- A **GitHub account**
- **Git Bash** installed and working
- **VS Code (Visual Studio Code)** installed for writing and editing code
- **Python** installed on your computer

## 📝 Task Description

We created a **simple calculator** using Python.

The calculator should:
1. Ask the user to enter two numbers
2. Ask the user to choose a math operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`)
3. Perform the operation and show the result

This helps us learn how to write programs that interact with users.

## 🧾 Example

If a user types:
- First number: `10`
-- Second number: `5`
- Operation: `+`

The program will show: 10 + 5 = 15

It works the same for `-`, `*`, and `/`.

---

## 📂 How to Run This Program

1. Open the file `calculator.py` in VS Code or any editor
2. Open a terminal (or Git Bash)
3. Navigate to the folder where `calculator.py` is saved using `cd`
4. Run the program with:

```bash
python calculator.py

Then;
Enter numbers and an operation when asked

And you will see your result on the screen
